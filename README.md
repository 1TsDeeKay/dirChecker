(NOT ALL FEATURES IMPLEMENTENT)

Hi, WebSquid is a experimental (WIP) webToolKit. and will have in the future auto exploitation. etc
later it will be more advanced with different technologies options like wordpress
and rate limit evasion, and maybe some attack options
and overall just more advanced options to make it more efficent, and to use the best wordlist / combination for the target site.












TODO FOR NEXT VERSION 0.4:
1. Add save options / make config
2. auto detect txt files / wordlists
3. unknown
