Hi, at this moment the dirChecker is basic (dirChecker should only be a Module / tool for the next script called webToolKit where many custom scripts are added into and combinated)
later it will be more advanced with different technologies options like wordpress
and rate limit evasion, and maybe some attack options
and overall just more advanced options to make it more efficent, and to use the best wordlist / combination for the target site.

















TODO FOR NEXT VERSION 0.2:
1. Add more Error Codes to url check
2. More user friendly (isnt it already? DUUH)
3. Polish code (remove eye cancer)

TODO FOR NEXT VERSION 0.3:
1. Add option to output a specific url status code in a txt file (multi selection possible)
2. Add auto Technologie Discovery
3. unknown

TODO FOR NEXT VERSION 0.4:
